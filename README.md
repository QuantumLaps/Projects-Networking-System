### **Contributions Handled : _Graph Theory_**

Functionalities as of now:
- Setting up Router Networks with Edges
- Calculation of Routing Tables via Bellmann Ford Algorithm in O(N^2);
- Finding the Maximal Strongly Connected Sub Network via KosaRaju Algorithm.
- Handling Link Failiure of between any two network routers with a direct edge.
- Added Link State Packet and Flooding Feature so that when flood occurs each router has access to LSP of the flood initiator.
- Added Optimal Cell Tower Placement Map is likened to a color,(channelâ€“colors are limited to four), and found where to economically position broadcast towers for maximum coverage via Four Color Map Problem || Vizing's theorem (Referenced)
